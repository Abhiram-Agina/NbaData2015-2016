###Data Transformation Process
 
 - For `NBApoints.csv`, the Player name will include “\information” after the players actual name. To remove this, in Excel, we use the  find and replace feature, and in the “Find” area, we put “\*”, and in the replace, we put “ “. This will clean up the player name feature to be just the name.
 - Similarly, for `nbasalaries.csv`, we do the same process. In the “Find” area, we put “,*”, and in the replace, we put “ “. This will clean up the player name feature to be just the name.
